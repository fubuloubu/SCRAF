# Smart Contract Risk Assessment Framework (SCRAF)
*Risk assessment framework for evaluating risks in smart contract-based protocols and decentralized applications*

----

This framework aims to give a risk assessment score derived from objective scores for the following aspects of a smart contract-based protocol or decentralized application targeting the Ethereum ecosystem:
* Design Assurance Level -- Hazard Severity and Liklihood
* Economic Throughput -- Total Funds vs Holding Time
* Complexity -- State Variables and State Transitions

This score will provide advisement of checkpoint items that should be provided in order to prove adequete testing methodology and reports exist.

----

The SCRAF framework is based on concepts obtained from the following standards:
* DO-178 [url]()
* OWASP Security Model [url]()
